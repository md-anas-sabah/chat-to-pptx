Project Details - 

Build an AI-powered chat application with functionality to generate and edit PowerPoint presentations.

Requirements
Main Chat Application UI


Create a chat interface similar to MagicSlides AI-Slide (https://www.magicslides.app/dashboard/ai-slide).


The UI should allow users to enter prompts/questions.


AI Integration


Use Gemini Reasoning Model (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06) for generating responses.


The AI should take user input and generate structured content for slides.


PPT Generation


Use pptxgenjs to generate PowerPoint presentations.


Once ready, show the generated PPT preview (no streaming needed).


Users should be able to:


Provide new prompts to edit/update slides.


Update PPT content dynamically using the JSON response from the AI.



Deliverables
A working chat-based UI (React/Next.js preferred).


AI integration with Gemini model.


PPT generation using pptxgenjs.


Ability to edit slides via user prompts.



Plus Points (Optional)
Add streaming for PPT generation (show progress).
